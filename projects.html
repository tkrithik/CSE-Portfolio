                    <p><b>Type of Project:</b> Team Project</p><br>
                    <p>The objective of this project was to create an interactive escape room, themed around
COVID-19, where the user can “escape” by interacting with the program through
typed commands. However, this entire project must be done without the use of any
loops. My team and I addressed the client’s request, the project criteria, and created an
escape room using Replit, where the user had to both use their general knowledge and
factual skills, along with their computer science skills. The user of our game needed
to solve problems as simple as word searches, and as hard as converting binary to
ASCII. Our project, which outputted questions on Replit’s command line, was also
well-formatted, with clear dividers and spaces, in order to deliver the most optimal
game experience to the client and player. We also made our game more challenging by
presenting the user with only two lives, which decreased with each incorrect answer.
My role in this project mainly revolved around coding the actual project, along with a
little documentation. Using Replit, we used major aspects of
python, such as lists, modules, and functions, to deliver our game. For example, we
imported the random module, which helped us randomize the letters in a word search
problem we included, thus allowing us to make the game a little different each time for
the user. We also imported a time module, which showed the user the amount of time
they have been playing the game for. A major challenge in our path was the lack of
loops. However, after much thought, we solved this by calling back-to-back functions
in order to create the loop effect. We also shortened our code length by storing the
questions and answers in a list, which we called upon by incrementing the list index
variable each time the user solved a problem correctly. Through my role in this
project, I strengthened my skills in many areas of Python, some of which included lists
and dictionaries, function calls and parameters, and importing modules. I also
improved my documentation skills, by documenting every sprint. Our team also created a video presenting our solution. Overall, both my partner
and I were extremely happy about this project, as it was not only fun but also
beneficial to our skills. As a team, we worked extremely well together, and
communicated questions, ideas and problems. We always helped each other out, and
could all agree that our roles greatly mattered to this project. Click the button to learn more!</p>

                    <p><b>Duration:</b> Approximately 4 weeks (October 2020 - Mid November 2020)</p>
                    <p><b>Type of Project:</b> Team Project</p><br>
                    <p>The objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly app revolving around a
current news topic. This app either needed to be an interactive game, an interactive
story, or an interactive media page. My team and I addressed the client’s request, the
project criteria, and developed an interactive user story, which was themed around
the news topic of COVID-19. The user of our game needed to solve ethical and
choice-making problems, such as deciding whether to wear a mask when going
outside, or washing your food after you buy it. Using MIT App Inventor, we
developed our app to be as user-friendly as possible. We included levels, buttons, and
a matching color scheme to make our app look more appealing. Furthermore, we also
challenged the user by limiting their lives to 2. However, we also allowed one hint
per game for the user, in case they were unable to solve a problem. Our app
displayed a question, along with an image and 4 buttons, a yes button, a no button, a
hint button, and a quit button. Based on the user’s selection, our app decremented the
user’s life if they incorrectly answered the question or ended the game if they had no
lives left. It also displayed a hint or ended the game if the hint or quit button was
selected. However, if the user correctly answered the given question, the app
continued on to the next question until the user won, or lost their lives. My role in
this project mainly revolved around developing and coding the back-end features of
this app, such as storing data in databases, working with functions, and checking the
user’s input. At first, I was unsure on how to store variables I needed to use for all
questions, as global variables reset with each screen or question. But then, after
background research, I decided on using databases to store values. For example, in
order to store the user’s lives across multiple questions, I stored the number of lives
the user had in a database, thus allowing me to call upon it when needed. My partner
and I also documented our process. Although MIT App
Inventor was a block-based coding site, this project allowed me to grow and
strengthen my fundamentals in computer science. Through participating in this
project, I not only strengthened my skills in places such as global and local scopes,
lists, and functions, but I also learned new valuable skills, like storing values in
databases. This project also introduced me to documentation, allowing me to
improve my skills here. Our team also created a video presenting our solution.
Overall, both my partner and I were very happy about the way this project turned
out. We worked well together, and always helped each other out. As a whole, we all
could agree that our roles greatly mattered to the development of this project. Click the button to learn more!</p>
